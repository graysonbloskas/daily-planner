# daily-planner
## About this project 
I was tasked with creating a daily planner that will display time slots, during normal business hours. These slots range from 9AM to 6PM. The jumbotron contains a moment method that displays the current date. 
The user is able to go into each time slot/row, and fill in specific tasks/schedules. They are then able to save those tasks using the button to the right of each time slot. 
Their input is stored on localstorage. 
Ultimately, this application allows for refreshing of the page, and no user input is lost.
